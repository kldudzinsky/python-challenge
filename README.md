Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

Background
Well... you've made it!
It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.


Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.



Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.
