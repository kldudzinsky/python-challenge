#You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
    #The total number of votes cast
    # A complete list of candidates who received votes
    # The percentage of votes each candidate won
    # The total number of votes each candidate won
    # The winner of the election based on popular vote.
#In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
